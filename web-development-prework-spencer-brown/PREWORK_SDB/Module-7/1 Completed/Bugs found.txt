All the bugs found

1.) <div> </div> formatting issues causing blockage
2.) in the .js quotations were needed around, Pink and Click for both the color function and the grow/shrink function.
3.) needed <li></li> for the list of Boo's favorite things
4.) Changing the color of the text needed both reformatting as well as changing the colors to the correct one (i.e. green>green not green>orange)
5.) Random Fact generator needed to fix the .js reference at the bottom of the page as well as adding quotations and commas in the right spots to seperate the facts.
6.) About Boo needed <p></p> to seperate the paragraphs from one another.
7.) The photo of boo needed < > around the whole line. 
8.) just to tidy it up I removed the instructions section to mimic the GrumpyCat file visually as much as I could in terms of formatting and end product.
